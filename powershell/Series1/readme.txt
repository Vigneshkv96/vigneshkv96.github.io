Hello 
	This is My series 1 of Powershell .
	Mainly this covers some basic powershell operations and have also included some basics of multi threading and runspace modues,
	Multi threading is a powerful way of performing multiple task simulatneously by utilizing cpu threads.
	In the coming days I'll be discussing about how to trigger two idividual scripts from one main script using Multi threading.

I hope this benifit all.
